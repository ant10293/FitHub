# Removal and Rename Recommendations (Updated)

## REMOVALS (26 total)

### ✅ **AGREE - Should Remove:**

1. **Landmine Floor Press** - "this just isn't practical"
   - **Agree**: Floor press with landmine is awkward and rarely used.

2. **Reverse Cable Crossover** - "REMOVE or change to high cable reverse fly"
   - **Recommendation**: I'd suggest RENAMING to "High Cable Reverse Fly" rather than removing. Reverse fly is a useful exercise.

3. **V-Up** - "same as jackknife situp"
   - **Agree**: These are essentially the same movement pattern.

4. **Half-Kneeling Landmine Press** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Very niche variation. Regular Landmine Press is sufficient.

5. **Lying Dumbbell External Shoulder Rotation** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Standing/Cable versions are more practical.

6. **Seated Dumbbell External Shoulder Rotation** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Standing/Cable versions are more practical.

7. **Lying Dumbbell Internal Shoulder Rotation** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Standing/Cable versions are more practical.

8. **Calf Press** - "this is leg press calf raise"
   - **Agree**: You already have "Leg Press Calf Raise" - redundant.

9. **Bayesian Curl** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Very obscure variation, not commonly known or used.

10. **Cable Curl With Rope** - "THIS IS A HAMMER CURL"
    - **Agree**: You already have "Cable Hammer Curl" - redundant.

11. **EZ-Bar Preacher Curl** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: You have "Preacher Curl" (which is being renamed to "Ez-Bar Preacher Curl") and "Machine Preacher Curl" - this is redundant.

12. **Reverse-Grip Preacher Curl** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Very niche variation, not commonly used.

13. **Stability-Ball Hamstring Curl** - "same as Stability-Ball Leg Curl"
    - **Agree**: These are the same exercise - redundant.

14. **Standing Cable Curl** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: You have many other curl variations. This one is less common.

15. **Elbow-Supported Knee Raise** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Very similar to other leg raises, not commonly distinguished.

16. **Elbow-Supported Leg Raise** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Very similar to other leg raises, not commonly distinguished.

17. **Diamond Cutter Push-Up** - "this is the same as diamond push-up"
    - **Agree**: Redundant with Diamond Push-Up.

18. **Kneeling Incline Push-Up** - "This is contradictory and not a valid exercise"
    - **Agree**: The name is contradictory.

19. **Cable Rear Delt Row** - "THIS IS A FACE PULL, REMOVE"
    - **Agree**: You already have "Face Pull" - this is a misnamed duplicate.

20. **Incline Row** - "this is Chest-Supported T-Bar Row"
    - **Agree**: You already have "Chest-Supported T-Bar Row" - redundant.

21. **Barbell Bulgarian Split Squat** - "No one does these, its not practical with a barbell"
    - **Agree**: Very awkward to perform. Dumbbell/Goblet versions are much more practical.

22. **Cambered Bar Squat** - "too niche and too similar to safety bar squat"
    - **Agree**: Very niche equipment, and Safety Bar Squat covers similar functionality.

23. **Chair Bulgarian Split Squat** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Chair variations are less common and less practical.

24. **Chair Squat** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Very basic variation, Box Squat is more useful.

25. **Half Squat** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Not a complete movement - encourages poor form.

26. **Overhead Cable Triceps Extension** - "REMOVE, but has data. this uses straight bar"
    - **Agree**: You have "Overhead Rope Triceps Extension" which is the proper variation.
