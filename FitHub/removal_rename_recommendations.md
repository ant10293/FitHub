# Removal and Rename Recommendations

## REMOVALS (26 total)

### ✅ **AGREE - Should Remove:**

1. **Landmine Floor Press** - "this just isn't practical"
   - **Agree**: Floor press with landmine is awkward and rarely used. Keep regular Floor Press.

2. **V-Up** - "same as jackknife situp"
   - **Agree**: These are essentially the same movement pattern. Keep Jackknife Sit-Up.

3. **Half-Kneeling Landmine Press** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Very niche variation. Regular Landmine Press is sufficient.

4. **Lying Dumbbell External Shoulder Rotation** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Standing/Cable versions are more practical and common.

5. **Seated Dumbbell External Shoulder Rotation** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Standing/Cable versions are more practical and common.

6. **Lying Dumbbell Internal Shoulder Rotation** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Standing/Cable versions are more practical and common.

7. **Calf Press** - "this is leg press calf raise"
   - **Agree**: You already have "Leg Press Calf Raise" - this is redundant.

8. **Bayesian Curl** - No reason given
   - **Agree**: Very obscure variation, not commonly known or used.

9. **Cable Curl With Rope** - "THIS IS A HAMMER CURL"
   - **Agree**: You already have "Cable Hammer Curl" - this is redundant.

10. **Preacher Curl** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: You have "EZ-Bar Preacher Curl" and "Machine Preacher Curl" - the generic "Preacher Curl" is ambiguous.

11. **Reverse-Grip Preacher Curl** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Very niche variation, not commonly used.

12. **Stability-Ball Hamstring Curl** - "same as Stability-Ball Leg Curl"
    - **Agree**: These are the same exercise - redundant.

13. **Standing Cable Curl** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: You have many other curl variations. This one is less common.

14. **Elbow-Supported Knee Raise** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Very similar to other leg raises, not commonly distinguished.

15. **Elbow-Supported Leg Raise** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Very similar to other leg raises, not commonly distinguished.

16. **Diamond Cutter Push-Up** - "this is the same as diamond push-up"
    - **Agree**: Redundant with Diamond Push-Up.

17. **Kneeling Incline Push-Up** - "This is contradictory and not a valid exercise"
    - **Agree**: The name is contradictory - can't be both kneeling and incline.

18. **Incline Row** - "this is Chest-Supported T-Bar Row"
    - **Agree**: You already have "Chest-Supported T-Bar Row" - redundant.

19. **Barbell Bulgarian Split Squat** - "No one does these, its not practical with a barbell"
    - **Agree**: Very awkward to perform. Dumbbell/Goblet versions are much more practical.

20. **Cambered Bar Squat** - "too niche and too similar to safety bar squat"
    - **Agree**: Very niche equipment, and Safety Bar Squat covers similar functionality.

21. **Chair Bulgarian Split Squat** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Chair variations are less common and less practical.

22. **Chair Squat** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Very basic variation, Box Squat is more useful.

23. **Half Squat** - No reason given
    - **Agree**: Not a complete movement - encourages poor form. Better to have full range exercises.

24. **Overhead Cable Triceps Extension** - "REMOVE, but has data. this uses straight bar"
    - **Agree**: You have "Overhead Rope Triceps Extension" which is the proper variation. The straight bar version is less common.

### ⚠️ **QUESTION - Need Clarification:**

25. **Reverse Cable Crossover** - "REMOVE or change to high cable reverse fly"
    - **Recommendation**: I'd suggest RENAMING to "High Cable Reverse Fly" rather than removing. Reverse fly is a useful exercise, and this is a valid variation.

26. **Single-Arm Dumbbell Preacher Curl** - "remove single-arm name?"
    - **Recommendation**: I'd suggest RENAMING to just "Dumbbell Preacher Curl" rather than removing. It's a valid exercise, just the name is redundant.
