# Naming Standardization Recommendations

## My Recommendations for Each Inconsistency

### 1. Reverse-Grip vs Reverse Grip
**Recommendation: Use "Reverse-Grip" (hyphen)**

**Reasoning:**
- You already consistently use hyphens for "Close-Grip" and "Wide-Grip"
- This creates a consistent pattern: Close-Grip, Wide-Grip, Reverse-Grip
- Only need to change 3 exercises (the ones with space)

**Change:**
- Reverse Grip Bench Press → Reverse-Grip Bench Press
- Reverse Grip Lat Pulldown → Reverse-Grip Lat Pulldown
- Reverse Grip Tricep Pushdown → Reverse-Grip Tricep Pushdown

---

### 2. Smith-Machine vs Smith Machine
**Recommendation: Use "Smith Machine" (space)**

**Reasoning:**
- Majority already uses space (4 vs 1)
- "Smith Machine" reads more naturally as two words
- Only need to change 1 exercise

**Change:**
- Smith-Machine Guillotine Press → Smith Machine Guillotine Press

---

### 3. Trap-Bar vs Trap Bar
**Recommendation: Use "Trap Bar" (space)**

**Reasoning:**
- Majority already uses space (2 vs 1)
- "Trap Bar" reads as two separate words (like "Safety Bar", "Hex Bar")
- Only need to change 1 exercise

**Change:**
- Trap-Bar Jump Squat → Trap Bar Jump Squat

---

### 4. Behind-the-Back vs Behind the Back
**Recommendation: Use "Behind the Back" (space)**

**Reasoning:**
- You already have "Behind the Neck Press" which uses space
- Consistency with "Behind the Neck" pattern
- The hyphenated version has awkward lowercase "the"
- Only need to change 1 exercise

**Change:**
- Behind-the-Back Barbell Shrug → Behind the Back Barbell Shrug

---

### 5. One-Arm vs Single-Arm
**Recommendation: Use "Single-Arm" (keep hyphen, change term)**

**Reasoning:**
- "Single-Arm" is used 7 times vs "One-Arm" used 1 time
- You consistently use "Single-Leg" everywhere, so "Single-Arm" matches that pattern
- Creates consistency: Single-Arm, Single-Leg
- Only need to change 1 exercise

**Change:**
- One-Arm Lat Pulldown → Single-Arm Lat Pulldown

---

### 6. EZ Bar vs EZ-Bar
**Recommendation: Use "EZ-Bar" (hyphen)**

**Reasoning:**
- Majority uses hyphen (2 vs 1)
- "EZ-Bar" treats it as a compound term (like "Close-Grip", "Wide-Grip")
- Only need to change 1 exercise

**Change:**
- EZ Bar Curl → EZ-Bar Curl

---

### 7. Tricep vs Triceps
**Recommendation: Use "Triceps" (plural)**

**Reasoning:**
- "Triceps" is the correct anatomical term (the muscle is always referred to as "triceps" in anatomy)
- More professional/accurate
- Need to change 5 exercises

**Changes:**
- Dumbbell Tricep Kickback → Dumbbell Triceps Kickback
- Machine Tricep Extension → Machine Triceps Extension
- Reverse Grip Tricep Pushdown → Reverse Grip Triceps Pushdown
- Tricep Pushdown With Bar → Triceps Pushdown With Bar
- Tricep Rope Pushdown → Triceps Rope Pushdown

---

## Summary of Changes Needed

**Total exercises to change: 13**

1. Reverse-Grip (3 changes) - Add hyphens
2. Smith Machine (1 change) - Remove hyphen
3. Trap Bar (1 change) - Remove hyphen
4. Behind the Back (1 change) - Remove hyphen
5. Single-Arm (1 change) - Change "One-Arm" to "Single-Arm"
6. EZ-Bar (1 change) - Add hyphen
7. Triceps (5 changes) - Change "Tricep" to "Triceps"

---

## Final Standardized Patterns

After changes, you'll have:
- **Hyphenated compound terms:** Close-Grip, Wide-Grip, Reverse-Grip, Single-Arm, Single-Leg, Plate-Loaded, EZ-Bar
- **Spaced compound terms:** Smith Machine, Trap Bar, Behind the Back, Behind the Neck
- **Consistent terminology:** Single-Arm (not One-Arm), Triceps (not Tricep)
