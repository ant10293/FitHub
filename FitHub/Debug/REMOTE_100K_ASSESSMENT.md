## 💡 YOUR PREFERENCE (Remote vs In-Person)

### **Your Stance:**
- $100k+ fully remote = ✅ Yes
- $150k+ in-person = ✅ Yes (if commute worth it)
- <$150k in-person = ❌ No (not worth commute)

### **This is Actually Smart:**

**Why Remote Makes Sense:**
- 45 min commute = 1.5 hours/day = 7.5 hours/week
- 7.5 hours/week = 390 hours/year
- That's ~$50/hour of your time (if $100k job)
- Remote = better work-life balance
- Remote = more flexibility

**Math:**
- $100k remote = $48/hour (if 40 hours/week)
- $100k in-person = $38/hour (if 45 min commute each way = 50 hours/week)
- Remote is actually **more valuable** per hour

**Your $150k in-person threshold makes sense:**
- $150k/50 hours = $57/hour
- Worth the commute premium
- But $100k remote is better value
