# Exercise Grouping Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Status
- **Total exercises**: 437
- **Grouped exercises**: 406
- **Ungrouped exercises**: 31
- **Total groups**: 44

---

## NEW GROUPS TO CREATE

### 1. **KETTLEBELL** (3 exercises)
Currently ungrouped:
- Kettlebell Bottoms-Up Press
- Kettlebell Halo
- Kettlebell Swing

**Recommendation**: Create a new "KETTLEBELL" group for these kettlebell-specific exercises.

---

### 2. **WRIST/FOREARM** (3 exercises)
Currently ungrouped:
- Rice-Bucket Wrist Twist
- Wrist Roller
- Plate Pinch (could also go in PLATE group)

**Recommendation**: Create a "WRIST/FOREARM" group. These are all grip/forearm strengthening exercises.

---

### 3. **ROTATIONAL CORE** (3 exercises)
Currently ungrouped:
- Cable Wood Chop
- Rotary Torso Twist
- Landmine Anti-Rotation

**Recommendation**: Create a "ROTATIONAL CORE" group for rotational core movements.

---

### 4. **SIDE BEND** (2 exercises)
Currently ungrouped:
- Dumbbell Side Bend
- Roman Chair Side Bend

**Recommendation**: Create a "SIDE BEND" group, or consider adding to a broader "CORE" category.

---

### 5. **Y-RAISE** (Expand existing or create new)
Currently ungrouped:
- I-Y-T Raise (on Bench)
- Incline Y Raise
- Scaption Raise

**Note**: There may already be a Y-RAISE group. If not, create one. Scaption Raise is essentially a Y-raise variation.

---

## EXERCISES TO ADD TO EXISTING GROUPS

### 1. **TRICEP EXTENSION** group
- **Tate Press** - This is a tricep extension variation (lying tricep extension with elbows flared)

### 2. **CALF RAISE** group
- **Calf Press** - This is essentially a calf raise done on a leg press machine
- **Tibialis Raise** - Could go here, or create separate "TIBIALIS RAISE" group (currently only 1 exercise)

### 3. **EXTENSION** group
- **Superman** - This is a back extension exercise

### 4. **LUNGE** group
- **Step Up** - Very similar movement pattern to lunges

### 5. **DEADLIFT** group
- **Rack Pull** - This is a partial deadlift variation
- **Good Morning** - Hip hinge movement similar to deadlift

### 6. **LEG RAISE (CORE)** group
- **Dragon Flag** - Core exercise similar to leg raises
- **Stability Ball Pike** - Core exercise with leg movement

### 7. **CARDIO** group
- **Burpees** - Full-body cardio exercise
- **Mountain Climbers** - Cardio/core exercise

---

## GROUPS TO CONSIDER CONSOLIDATING

### Small Groups (2-3 exercises) that might be merged:

1. **AB ROLLOUT** (2 exercises) - Could potentially merge with CORE/PLANK group
2. **FRONT RAISE** (2 exercises) - Could merge with LATERAL RAISE into "RAISE" group
3. **FACE PULL** (2 exercises) - Could merge with REAR DELT exercises if you have them, or keep separate
4. **FLOOR PRESS** (3 exercises) - Could merge with BENCH PRESS, but you've kept them separate for a reason
5. **CHIN UP** (3 exercises) - Could merge with PULL UP, but you've kept them separate
6. **THRUSTER** (2 exercises) - Could merge with SQUAT or SHOULDER PRESS, but it's a unique movement
7. **WALL SIT** (2 exercises) - Could merge with HOLD or SQUAT group
8. **GLUTE KICKBACK** (2 exercises) - Could merge with BRIDGE group

---

## EXERCISES THAT NEED SPECIAL CONSIDERATION

### Anti-Rotation Exercises
- **Pallof Press** - Currently ungrouped. Could create "ANTI-ROTATION" group with Landmine Anti-Rotation

### Plate Exercises
- **Plate Flip** - Unique explosive movement, might stay ungrouped
- **Plate Raise** - Could go in FRONT RAISE or LATERAL RAISE
- **Plate Pinch** - Wrist/forearm exercise (see WRIST/FOREARM group above)

### Unique Exercises (may stay ungrouped)
- **Cable Pull Through** - Hip hinge movement, could go in DEADLIFT or BRIDGE
- **Frog Pump** - Glute exercise, could go in BRIDGE group
- **Medicine Ball Slam** - Explosive movement, could create "SLAM" group or add to CARDIO

---

## SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS

### High Priority (Create New Groups):
1. ✅ **KETTLEBELL** - 3 exercises
2. ✅ **WRIST/FOREARM** - 3 exercises  
3. ✅ **ROTATIONAL CORE** - 3 exercises

### Medium Priority (Add to Existing):
1. ✅ Tate Press → TRICEP EXTENSION
2. ✅ Calf Press → CALF RAISE
3. ✅ Superman → EXTENSION
4. ✅ Step Up → LUNGE
5. ✅ Rack Pull → DEADLIFT
6. ✅ Good Morning → DEADLIFT
7. ✅ Dragon Flag → LEG RAISE (CORE)
8. ✅ Burpees → CARDIO
9. ✅ Mountain Climbers → CARDIO

### Low Priority (Consider Consolidating):
- Consider merging very small groups (2 exercises) if they're closely related
- Keep groups separate if they represent distinct movement patterns

## QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

1. Should **Tibialis Raise** get its own group, or be added to CALF RAISE?
2. Should **Y-Raise variations** get their own group, or be added to FRONT/LATERAL RAISE?
3. Should **Anti-Rotation** exercises get their own group?
4. Should **Plate exercises** get their own group, or be distributed?
